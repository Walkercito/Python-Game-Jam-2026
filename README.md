## Overview

**Before Nightfall** is a local and online co-op platformer made for [PyWeek 41](https://pyweek.org/41/). Two friends, **Fig** and **Moss**, need to make it through the town's portals before nightfall closes them all. Work together, press plates, open doors, and platform your way home.

- **Local split-screen co-op** with dynamic LEGO-style camera
- **Online multiplayer** via party codes (LAN or internet with ngrok)
- **Narrated intro** with cinematic typewriter text
- **Multiple levels** with progressive mechanics

## How to Play

### Controls

| Action | Player 1 (WASD) | Player 2 (Numpad) | Player 2 (Arrows) |
|--------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Move | `A` / `D` | `1` / `3` | `←` / `→` |
| Jump | `W` | `5` | `↑` |
| Fast Fall | `S` | `2` | `↓` |

Controls are customizable in Settings. Players can swap between WASD, Numpad, and Arrows.

### Mechanics

- **Pressure plates** - Stand on them to open doors (some close when you step off)
- **Co-op plates** - Color-coded plates that need the right player standing on them
- **Breakable platforms** - They crumble on contact
- **One-way platforms** - Jump through from below, land on top
- **Moving platforms** - Ride them between waypoints
- **Stairs** - Climb up and down
- **Water** - Slower movement, floaty physics
- **Lava** - Get out fast or you're toast
- **Portals** - Reach them to advance to the next level
